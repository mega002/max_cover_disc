# Max Cover Disc

This project is an implementation of a maximum cover problem in CGAL, as part of a contest which took part on the Computational Geometry course in Tel-Aviv University, 2017. The project won the first place, with the best running time performance.

The problem is as follows:
Given a real parameter r > 0 and a set P of n points in the plane, find the disc of radius r that covers the maximum number of points in P. 
Required running time: O(n^2 log(n))
